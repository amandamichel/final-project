# Ethics of Passive Data Collection
## Where to draw the line between progress and privacy?

Notes:
PDC: data generated without the active participation of the subject
primary focus of study: informational privacy, informed consentm and data security

phone tracks gps/accelerometer data - physical movements
general phone usage: patterns, "communicative metadata"

progress: this data is in an individual's standard lifestyle, not a hospital or with extenuating circumstances. this data is also collected countinously

since the data is collected in a home evirionment, the subject can end up sharing data that wasn't intended (arg against: enhance privacy - allow treatment to be administer in the home environment)

✨consent✨: current methods of obtaining informed consent are not enough: no one reads the terms and conditions. literally no one. *even* if people did, the issue of third parties comes in: who has borrowed your phone for a phone call or a google search? conclusions of passive data could involve family member who didnt provide consent. What about texts and private messages on social media?  

proposed solution? interactive consent features. constantly checking in, offer a spectrum of consent

what if you get consent? this still causes people to feel "tracked"; what should be done with accidental findings?
