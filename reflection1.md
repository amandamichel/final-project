# Passive Data Collection in Medicine
## The line between progress and privacy

**Passive data collection** generates data without the active participation of the subject. This means that the data being collected is not always directly and freely given by the subject. Consider a scenario where someone has been hospitalized, then discharged, and can now reside in her home. She may do so with one stipulation: the hospital must moniter her constantly. They use GPS and accelerometer data to track physical movements, can view her general phone patterns, and can even analyze communications. The amount of data being collected in this scenario is argueably too much and brings about an abundance of ethical hang-ups, chiefly in the ways of informed consent.

Before considering the ethical dilemmas present in passive data collection, an understanding of what it is used for- and its relative advantages, is required first. Passive data collection is often used hand-in-hand with another concept called **predictive analytics**. The passively-collected data is passed into predictive algorithms which use AI to predict certain medical conditions or outcomes, based on previously analyzed data. Keep in mind that modern predictive algorithms can take in a virtually unlimited number of variables, making them far more accurate than their predecessors, that could only take in less than ten. From the perspective of scientific progress, passive data collection has very obvious advantages- notably, that the data is collected continuously and that it is taken in the subject's home environment. This increases the accuracy of the data, as well as it scope. There are some arguments in favor of passively collected data, going as far as saying they protect individual privacy by allowing medical studies to be conducted in the subject's home. 

Many people have considered, researched, and debated the ethics of performing studies with the techniques described above. A large ethical problem that makes itself present here is the informed consent of the user. Even when companies ask for consent, the dreaded "Terms & Conditions" are something most people are guilty of scrolling past and clicking "accept." Informed consent does not happen when the consumer is not adequately informed. Some proposed solutions to that include constant, interactive consent and regulations being placed on what data can actually be saved and stored/what to do with unpredicted results. However, even if it could be guaranteed that everyone would read the "Terms & Conditions", the problem of third parties is something major to consider. How often do individuals borrow other's phones, even if for just one search or call? These individuals have not consented to anything, and thus, another ethical dilemma makes itself known.

Predictive analytics and passive data collection are both relatively new fields. There is no prerequisite to base ethical checks off of, and because of this, there is virtually no industry standard when it comes to the privacy of the data being collected. This is dangerous, and people often are unwilling to consider the damage that could be done to them if the field is allowed to progress without regulation.

<!-- Notes:
PDC: data generated without the active participation of the subject
primary focus of study: informational privacy, informed consentm and data security
phone tracks gps/accelerometer data - physical movements
general phone usage: patterns, "communicative metadata"
progress: this data is in an individual's standard lifestyle, not a hospital or with extenuating circumstances. this data is also collected countinously
since the data is collected in a home evirionment, the subject can end up sharing data that wasn't intended (arg against: enhance privacy - allow treatment to be administer in the home environment)
consent: current methods of obtaining informed consent are not enough: no one reads the terms and conditions. literally no one. *even* if people did, the issue of third parties comes in: who has borrowed your phone for a phone call or a google search? conclusions of passive data could involve family member who didnt provide consent. What about texts and private messages on social media?  
proposed solution? interactive consent features. constantly checking in, offer a spectrum of consent
what if you get consent? this still causes people to feel "tracked"; what should be done with accidental findings?

clinicians don't understand algorithms the way they understoof the old ones - harder to evaluate - can't be held to traditional clinic trial standards: what *should* the standard be
what exactly is predictive analytics? use of predictive algorithms on a set of input variable to predict an outcome -->
