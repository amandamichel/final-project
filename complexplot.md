# Getting Started with RStudio: A More Complicated Plot + Challenge

## A More Complicated Plot

![](path_btw_homes.png)

My variables x and y each had a range of 1 to 100. Ten random dwellings were established and added to a data frame. I also created 20 trees at random locations- 10 big and 10 small. Three random dwellings were chosen and labeled; and path between them was added to the plot.


## Challenge Question Plot

![](challenge_question_plot_W1.png)

I set my variables according to the instructions: x and y each with a range of 1 to 1000. I then produced 50 dwellings at random by using the "sample(...)" command and assigning 50 values to each east and west, then assigning each coordinate set an id number; these dwellings were put on the plot via the "symbols(...)" command. Again, using the "symbols(...)" and "sample(...)" commands, I created 40 small trees and 12 big trees. At random, seven dwellings were selected and using the "xspline(...)" command, the path between them was added to the plot.
