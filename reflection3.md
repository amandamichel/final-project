# An Intro to Deep AI
## Defining Deep Learning and Genetic Programming

AI is an ever expanding field within Data Science. The purpose of this field as a whole is to mimic the human brain as closely as possible in technology. Naturally, a starting point in both the development and understanding of AI is something called Genetic Programming.

Genetic Programming simualates Darwinian evolution, To understand this, consider the following example: imagine the initial population set is a random selection of William & Mary students. The measure of fitness we select is favorite color, that is, anyone whose favorite color is green or yellow is considered a part of the most "fit" group. Then, through direct copies, crossovers, and genetic mutations, a new generation is born. This process continues until we hit a final or goal criteria, say 95% of students favorite colors are green and yellow.

So, a genetic program is given some constant values, a measure of fitness, and a terminating criteria. The starts the simulation with an initial random "population" set, measure its individuals against some fitness criteria, and select the top individuals to reproduce for the next generation. This process continues until the program arrives at a specified endpoint. The premise of this type of program is to not directly control the output of the program. Rather, it is to give the program a starting point and allow it to learn from itself.

Within the field as a whole, deep AI and deep learning are also gaining traction. But what exactly distinguishes deep learning from more traditional "shallow learning"? To understand that, we must first look at what these programs do. First these models are "taught" about a specific type of data during what is called the training period. From this, the model constructs neural networks. These mimic the functionality and structure of the human brain. These networks are then used to process new data with virtually no input from humans.

The data is structured in layers, and the corresponding levels of the nueral nerwork abstract and transform the data into the desired output. *Here*, is where the difference between deep learning and shallow learning can be found: the complexity and *depth* of these levels. Deep learning has deeper levels of heirarchal abstraction and representations. Practically, this means deep learning can process more complex and larger quantities of data than its shallow counterpart, allowing applications like automatic speech recognition, computer vision, and natural language processing.
