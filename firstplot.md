## Challenge Question Plot

![](challenge_question_plot_W1.png)

I set my variables according to the instructions: x and y each with a range of 1 to 1000. I then produced 50 dwellings at random using the "sample(...)" command and assigning 50 values to each east and west, then assigning each coordinate set an id number; these dwellings were put on the plot via the "symbols(...)" command. Again, using the "symbols(...)" and "sample(...)" commands, I created 40 small trees and 12 big trees. At random, seven dwellings were selected and using the "xspline(...)" command the path between them was added to the plot.
