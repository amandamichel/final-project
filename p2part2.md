# Project Two, Part Two: Intro to Data Science - Using the Stock Market to Describe, Analyze and Predict
For this projects, I wanted to look at how the worth fast food companies can impact a delivery company, like UberEats. So, I selected UBER to be my predicted stock and my predictive stocks as MCD, YUM, CMG, SBUX, and DNKN. These are Uber, McDonald's, Yum!Brands (parent company to Taco Bell, KFC, & Pizza Hut), Chipotle, 
#Starbucks, Dunkin' Donuts respectively. <br/>

## Deliverable One
The following plot is split into nine sections by total population differences from 2010 to 2014. In other words, the only qualifier as to how this plot is split is the total difference in population from 2010 to 2014. The greatest differences are found in bracket one.<br/>

## Deliverable Two
This plot is split by average annual growth rate. The average growth rate taken is calculated by first calculating the annual growth rates individually from 2010 to 2011, then 2011 to 2012, and so on. These four rates are averaged together, and through that average is this plot split up. The greatest growth rates are found in bracket nine.<br/>
