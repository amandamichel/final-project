## A closer look into the FiveThirtyEight Presidential Forecast 

It is difficult to have any conversation now without devolving into discussions regarding the proverbial elephant (and donkey) looming over us all. Take a moment and recall what the majority of Americans believed four years ago: that, with relative certainty, Hillary Clinton would be the president-elect come November. This belief was not unfounded- the vast majority of predictive models predicted Clinton to be the clear, undisputed victor. The major predictive model that gave Trump the highest chance of winning? The FiveThirtyEight Presidential Forcast.

Nate Silver simplifies their approach to the predictive model into three major steps: taking in and adjusting polls, weighing the impact of "fundamentals", and accounting for uncertaincy before simulating the election.
