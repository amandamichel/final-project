The following plot considers U.S. Census data collected in 2000, 2010, and 2014. The plot shows the population of individual states (as well as D.C. and Puerto Rico) as a function of the year. Each state gets its own line, and the plot is split up into four quadrants, based on the range of population, to improve readability.
